EP035 - Interruption Management

Abstract
########

This blueprint details a mechanism for NApps providing services
to receive information on interruptions,
and provide information on the affected services back
to the source of the interruption.
Additionally, this blueprint details how NApps which produce
interruptions should signal them in order to take advantage
of this new mechanism.

##########
Motivation
##########

In order for NApps which produce service interruptions
to receive information on what services they are affecting,
there needs to be a two way communication channel between
the service provider and the interruption source.
The kytos event bus provides only one way communication,
making it unsuitable for this task.

#############
Specification
#############

The following is a set of proposed changes for
how to handle interruptions in the future,
in order to have visibility on there causes and effects.

Kytos Core Changes
##################

In order for services to identify which interruptions are affecting the devices
they use, a mechanism needs to be added to the device representation for
identify interruption causes.


Extend ``status_funcs`` to produce a ``status_reason``
------------------------------------------------------

Currently, when an object is queried about its ``status``,
the reason for that status is unknown.
What we propose here is adding a new property to
``GenericEntity`` called ``status_reason``,
and adding in ``status_reason_func``
to produce values for ``status_reason``.
The produced ``status_reason`` will be a set of strings,
so all possible reasons a device might be disable
can be easily represented.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: python3

    from kytos.core.switch import Switch
    maintenance_switches = set()

    def switch_maintenance_status(switch):
        if switch.id in maintenance_switches:
            return EntityStatus.DOWN
        return EntityStatus.UP

    Switch.register_status_func('maintenance', switch_maintenance_status)

    def switch_maintenance_reason(switch):
        if switch.id in maintenance_switches:
            return {'maintenance'}
        return set()

    Switch.register_status_reason_func('maintenance', switch_maintenance_reason)


New Topology REST Endpoints
###########################

The following set of new endpoints are intended to allow
for previewing the affects of adding in interruptions.


REST Endpoint ``GET /topology/v3/preview_interruption``
-------------------------------------------------------

For all know service providers,
previews affected if the specified interruption occurs now.

Expected Input:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /topology/v3/preview_interruption?switch=<switch_id>&link=<link_id>&interface=<interface_id>&type=<interruption_type>


Expected Response:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        <provider name str>: [<service name str>],
    }

Side Effects:

- None

Notes:

- Should support multiple key-value pairs with the same key in the query parameters.


Endpoint: ``GET <url for previewing>``
--------------------------------------

For the given service provider,
previews services affected if the specified interruption occurs now.

Expected Input:

.. code-block:: http

    GET <preview_url>?switch=<switch_id>&link=<link_id>&interface=<interface_id>&type=<interruption_type>

Expected Output:

.. code-block:: json

    [
        {
            'id': <service name str>,
        },
    ]

Side Effects:

- None

Notes:

- Should support multiple key-value pairs with the same key in the query parameters.

New Kytos Events
################

The following set of event listeners are intended to be used to notify
other NApps when a change to the status of a set of devices occurs.

KytosEvent ``topology.interruptions.start``
-------------------------------------------

Notify services of an interruption starting,
after the interruption provider has already updated the status.

Expected Input:

.. code-block:: python3

    {
        "type": <interruption type str>,
        "switches": [<switch id>],
        "interfaces": [<interface id>],
        "links": [<link id>],
    }

Side Effects:

- Notifies the other NApps of the start of the interruption on the selected devices.


KytosEvent ``topology.interruptions.end``
-----------------------------------------

Notify services of an interruption ending,
after the interruption provider has already updated the status.

.. code-block:: python3

    {
        "type": <interruption type str>,
        "switches": [<switch id>],
        "interfaces": [<interface id>],
        "links": [<link id>],
    }

##############
Rejected Ideas
##############

Several different approaches had been considered during the creation of this blueprint.
Originally it was intended that a REST API would be developed for controlling
the state of interruptions in addition to querying there effects.
That version of this proposal would have also required
extending topology to manage the state of interruptions.
